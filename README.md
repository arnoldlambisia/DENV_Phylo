**#DENV_Phylo**

##Introduction

DENV_Phylo is a bioinformtics pipeline that runs using nextfow. The pipeline is used to perform phylogenetic analysis of Dengue data from [GISAID](https://gisaid.org/). 

##Pipeline

The pipeline has four key stages:

1. Data cleanup using ([r-base](https://www.r-project.org/))

>This step uses an [R script](bin/data_cleanup_subset.R) that takes inputs of a fasta and a metadata file downloaded from gisaid
